# Hi there -- I'm ‚ú® Mai! üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú® 

üíñ I'm a Full-Stack Developer with a background in higher education and the non-profit sector, where I worked closely with people with disabilities. Currently, I‚Äôm collaborating with two different engineering teams, which has strengthened my ability to communicate effectively, adapt quickly, and contribute as a reliable team player. I‚Äôm passionate about designing efficient APIs and building accessible, user-centered applications. 

### About Me
- üéì Transitioned from higher education/nonprofit sector, with a focus on disability advocacy.
- üí¨ Ask me about JavaScript, React, Svelte, Node.js, and accessibility in tech.
- üåç Based in Brooklyn but from New Orleans -- the heart of bounce music and genuine connections.
- üí° One of my special interests is psychology and understanding human relationships.
- üéß Lover of sad-girl indie/alternative music as well as some light post-punk tunes and anything that feels like the soundtrack from a coming-of-age film.

### Fun Fact

- Did you know that one of my hobbies is ceramics? I'm particularly interested in hand-building and recreating objects I've lost throughout my life. One day, I plan to showcase pieces inspired by the items I lost during Hurricane Katrina when I was nine.
